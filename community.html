        <p>Outdoor yoga combines the physical and mental benefits of yoga with the calming effects of nature.
            Participants can enhance flexibility, strength and balance while also reducing stress and increasing
            mindfulness. Practicing yoga can also boost mood, increase vitamin D intake and create a deeper

    <section id="bike-rides">
       <h2>Bike Rides For Beinners</h2>
       <img src="bike.jpg" width="250" height="200">
<p>Beginner bike rides help participants improve their health and build endurance in a low-impact way.
    It is common knowledge that The Netherlands is well-known for cycling and a lot of internationals
    do not know how to ride a bike. These sessions often include instructions on proper bike handling,
    road safety, and how to build confidence in cycling. They are fantastic for getting moving, discovering new places and leading an active lifestyle.</p>
